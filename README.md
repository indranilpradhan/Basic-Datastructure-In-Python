# Basic-Datastructure-In-Python

Priya has opened a brand new bakery whose building looks like a tree. She cooks really amazing
cakes that not only attracts nearby customers but also wild animals too. While browsing the
internet, she came across an advertisement telling about animal repellents.
The node of a tree determines the module size of the bakery and the value written inside it
determines the amount of repellant to be used. Priya wants to use the repellant on all the nodes that
are present on the boundary of the tree.
Write a python program that helps Priya to determine the total amount (in words) of repellant that
she needs to buy and the order (in words) in which she needs to apply it (counterclockwise in our
case.)
